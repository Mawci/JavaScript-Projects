<strong><b>Pizza Menu</b></strong>
<br>This project is a menu used to order pizza based on the size and variety of user-selected toppings. It then takes the input information, calculates
a price for the order, and then displaya all items selected with the subtotal. 

<br><strong>Tic Tac Toe Game</strong>
<br>The classic game of Tic Tac Toe. User will start first with X's and the computer will randomly roll and place an O for its turn. Win line is drawn and
sound is played for the winner with the game being reset and and the loser going first next game.

<br><strong>Calculator</strong>
<br>This is a basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply, and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator. 

<br><strong>To-Do App</strong>
<br>This was a simple project to practice JavaScript that allows you to input a task into the text field, add the task into an array, and click on a button to
remove the task. 

<br><strong>Academy Cinemas</strong>
<br>This was a project that I went back to from my HTML and CSS projects to add JavaScript. This website now displays the show times and titles of different movie
selections with the option to purchase tickets. There are 2 drop down selections for selecting the movie and show time, and one option to input the amount of tickets.
All the information is saved and calculated to return a confirmed purchace pop-up toast centered in the screen displaying the order when the user clicks submit.
